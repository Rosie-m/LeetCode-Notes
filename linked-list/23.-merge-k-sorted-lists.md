# 23. Merge k Sorted Lists

### Priority Queue

Unlike merging two lists, it is hard to compare the value between k lists. To find the smallest value among `k` nodes, we need a Priority Queue.\
I push a pair of `(value, list_idx)` to the PQ to tell which list the node popped out comes from. Instead, you can also push the node itself, then `push(node.next)`.

```python
class Solution(object):
    def mergeKLists(self, lists):
        """
        :type lists: List[ListNode]
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        node = dummy
        pq = []
        # Push the first elements of each lists to pq
        # if the list is not empty
        for i, l in enumerate(lists):
            if l:
                heapq.heappush(pq, (l.val, i))
                lists[i] = lists[i].next
               
        while len(pq) > 0:
            # Pop and insert to result list
            val, list_idx = heapq.heappop(pq)
            node.next = ListNode(val)
            # Forward the pointer
            node = node.next
            # Push next element in this list to pq if next exists
            if lists[list_idx]:
                heapq.heappush(pq, (lists[list_idx].val, list_idx))
                lists[list_idx] = lists[list_idx].next
        
        return dummy.next
```

`O(N*logk))` time and `O(k)` space (the size of Priority Queue) where `N` is the total number of nodes in the k lists.
