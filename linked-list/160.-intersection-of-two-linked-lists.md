```python

        """
        :type head1, head1: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        
        # p1 starting from headA and 
        # p2 starting from headB
        # How to make sure they come to the intersect point at the same time?
        # ==> What the difference of # of steps it takes to the intersect?
        # len(l1) - len(l2)
        # So, how we create such a length
        # Idea #1: Manual let one pointer move forward the diff before letting them move together
        # Idea #2: Let p1 pass l1 then l2; meanwhile, let p2 pass l2 then l1.
        
        p1 = headA
        p2 = headB
        while p1 != p2:
            if p1:
                p1 = p1.next
            else:
                p1 = headB
            if p2:
                p2 = p2.next
