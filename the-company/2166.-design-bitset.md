# 2166. Design Bitset

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/design-bitset" %}
Problem Statement
{% endembed %}

> * `1 <= size <= 10^5`&#x20;
> * `0 <= idx <= size - 1`
> * At most `10^5` calls will be made **in total** to `fix`, `unfix`, `flip`, `all`, `one`, `count`, and `toString`.
> * At least one call will be made to `all`, `one`, `count`, or `toString`.
> * At most `5` calls will be made to `toString`.

This problem requires all the operations except `toString` be O(1).&#x20;

### How to store the bitset?

#### Idea #1: String (char list)

* Pros
  * O(1) access with index
  * O(1) Flip any bit in-place
* Cons
  * `flip` can be O(n). (Will be solved later)

#### Idea #2: Binaries

* Pros
  * Bitwise operation \~ O(1)
  * `toString` is easy to implement&#x20;
    * Python: `bin`
    * C++: `std::bitset`
  * Space efficiency - no list needed, one integer is enough
* Cons
  * A little bit miserable if you're not confident with bitwise operation

### How to restrict the time complexity to O(1)?

#### Problem #1: `all`, `one`, `count`

All cares about the number of '1's.&#x20;

\==> Solution: track the number of '1's online

* Increment when `fix` a '0'
* Decrement when `unfix` a '1'.
* Change when `flip`

#### Problem #2: `flip`

{% hint style="info" %}
Flipping twice does nothing.
{% endhint %}

\==> Solution: record the current state (flipped or not)

* &#x20;Take `NOT(^)` or `XOR 1` when `flip`.
* `toString` should compose the flipped string if `isFlipped`&#x20;
  * NOTE: Have to compose a new string. Don't change it in-place. (Or your `isFlipped` will be inconsistent)
